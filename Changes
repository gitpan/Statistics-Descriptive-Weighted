Revision history for Perl extension Statistics::Descriptive::Weighted.

0.70 Mar 26, 2012

Handle empty arguments to add_data.
Fixed Bug ID 93761 "Error in get_data() when min value is 0"

0.60 Mar 18, 2012

Fixed an initialization error introduced by implementation changes
to base-class Statistics::Descriptive. 

Attribute "mean" seemed no longer to be initialized with base class new().

This caused an initialization error at the first use of add_data().

The mean attribute is now initialized in Statistics::Descriptive::Weighted.
