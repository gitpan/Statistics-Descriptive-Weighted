Welcome to Statistics::Descriptive::Weighted. This module partially extends
Statistics::Descriptive to handle weighted variates.

Although some functionality (particularly trimmed mean, least squares fit,
geometric mean and others, see man page for full listing) of
Statistics::Descriptive has been intentionally dropped from this extension,
other functionality has been added. 

In particular, besides adding support for weighted variates, a cdf function,
a quantile function, a percentile function, and other related functions have
been added (see man page for details). The quantile and percentile functions
offer quite different definitions for similar concepts, please see man page
for more info on that as well.

The implementation uses Tree::Treap written by Andrew Johnson (version 0.02
downloaded in Dec, 2008 from http://stuff.siaris.net and incorporated under
the terms of Perl licensing) which, since it was not on CPAN, is provided
and automatically installed with this package. This is an implementation of
a randomized self-balancing binary search tree called a treap.

To install this package please say:

perl Makefile.pl
make
make test
(sudo) make install
man Statistics::Descriptive::Weighted
